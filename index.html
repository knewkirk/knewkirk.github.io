        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <h3>December 13, 2016</h3>
        <p class="bio-main">
            I'm a 25 year old guy living in San Francisco, learning how to live a better
            life.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently not working for anyone but myself, and this is how I ended up there.
            <br><br>
            I was born and raised in a suburb of San Jose, California called Almaden, where I had
            a great time at elementary and middle school. I then went to Bellarmine College Prep
            in Downtown San Jose, where I enjoyed my math and physics classes, played roller
            hockey, and was a diver on our swimming and diving team.
            It was also during this time that I had the opportunity and pleasure of starting
            to work - as a swim team and dive team coach, lessons instructor, and lifeguard.
            I had a great time at the pool, and was so happy I could make a job out of it,
            talking with other people and solve problems that they faced.
            Outside of school and athletics, I began tinkering on my computer, and found
            a love for making things look good - like MySpace and iPod themes. :)
            <br><br>
            I attended the University of California in Los Angeles, where I started my time
            studying Electrical Engineering. After a few major classes, I realized that, while
            I did ok in the classes, I didn't really enjoy the hardware side of computers, and
            had more fun playing around and exploring the software on my laptop. As
            a result, I decided to switch majors - into Computer Science and Engineering, a mix
            of both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, so I could use the experience
            I had already gained in EE while at the same time exploring what was possible with
            software. I enjoyed this quite a bit more, and especially liked the projects and
            applications we had the chance to build as part of the curriculum. Outside of classwork,
            I was the team manager for the NCAA Women's Diving Team, and also joined the
            Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, where I was the social chair for one year.
            <br><br>
            My third year, I was fortunate enough to get an internship at VMware on the Octopus team,
            which was building a hybrid on-premise/cloud
            file storage application, and I was given the task
            of making the web application compatible with the mobile web. It was here that I fell in
            love with the web and the related languages and technologies, especially building and
            improving the parts of the application with which the end user directly interacts, which
            I later learned had a fancy name - UI/UX. At the end of my internship,
            I was given the opportunity to continue working for VMware throughout the
            school year, something not given to many interns. I was very fortunate to be able
            to continue developing my skills in the industry while finishing my education.
            <br><br>
            That fall I also was referred by one of my friends to take a look at Box, another
            web/cloud company, so I was naturally very interested in the position. I got the offer,
            and was very excited to be joining a slightly more exciting and faster paced company.
            I joined the Performance Team, a key part of the greater Web Application team, tasked
            with bringing page load times down for the end user. While I did not get to work
            directly on the UI very often, it was a great way to get a more comprehensive look
            at a web application and learn more about the different moving parts - databases,
            caching, assets, routing, deployment, release, feature rollout - and languages -
            SQL, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS.
            <br><br>
            After a year or so of making mostly server-side optimizations like more effecient
            data access and removing unnecessary assets, we decided that the best use
            of our time was to drastically reduce our payload size, and only reasonable
            way to do that would be to rewrite the front end of the application. Our
            goals were to create a new foundation that would be much more lightweight,
            but also easier to develop new features on top of, and improve site stability.
            As only one of three team members, I had the responsibility of creating
            a new backend presentation layer on top
            of the old business logic, to isolate our new clean code from the old,
            bloated, convoluted code.
            <br><br>
            After the foundation was in place, I was able to
            do more frontend development and work on reusable components like
            a contact selector, quick search, move and copy operations, right rail item details
            and pages like folder settings and search results.
            I also had the chance to work on Box's new React UI library,
            where I built a few minor components like dropdowns and form elements with React,
            which I found to be a very intuitive and powerful way to build a UI.
            Throughout the process, I played a large role in keeping the new code
            clean and organized, and providing direction and mentorship for interns and new hires.
            <br><br>
            We GA'd the project in September of 2016, after two years of hard work,
            and three years after I began my career at Box. I had thought about
            moving to product or people management a few times;
            I saw myself evolving into more of a business-oriented
            role learning about different aspects of the company, and figured I would
            be good at working with all kinds of people in different roles.
            I unfortunately could not find mentorship or guidance there; we had at least
            four different product managers, just as many designers, and many teammates
            were starting to leave towards the tail end of the project. There had never been a strong
            product focus in the company, and it was often unclear as to the direction
            management was taking the product. While I still wasn't completely sure,
            I knew that I at least wanted to be a
            part of making something beautiful that people enjoyed using,
            and this was not a big part of the company culture or misson. I decided that
            the next step in my career was not going to be made at Box.
            <br><br>
            The standard in society is to work, at all costs. To always be making money,
            to always be saving up to buy a nice big house or a fancy car. If you're going
            to leave your company, you should probably have another gig lined up,
            because no one <i>doesn't work</i>. So, I started looking for jobs outside
            while still working. I interviewed at a couple startups, a couple larger companies,
            and not doing a great job of preparing myself, because I wasn't thrilled about
            rushing into another position that might end up the same way, and I was quite frankly
            really burnt out.
            <br><br>
            Deep down, what I really wanted was to take a break. A break from mindless coding.
            A break from politics. A break from spinning my wheels for something I
            didn't care about. A chance to take a step back and really think about my future.
            A chance to do what I wanted again. I was fortunate enough to have saved
            enough up to not have to work, so I quit. Without any immediate plans.
            <br><br>
            Since then, I've started going to the gym again, meditating, reading, volunteering,
            cooking for my wonderful girlfriend, taking and editing more pictures,
            riding around the city on an old bike I bought, exploring some project ideas I've had,
            spending more time with my friends and family, and, on occasion,
            slacking off and doing nothing. I have (loose) plans to travel to Seattle, Tahoe,
            the East Coast, Utah, and Japan. Hopefully I'll follow through on them.
            It's stressed me out more than a few times, the whole not having a job thing.
            I'm worried I'll lose the skills I have. I'm worried people will think I'm lazy.
            I'm worried this wasn't a good decision. But I think I'm starting to be ok with it.
            I've got plenty of time, plenty of things to do,
            and I know I'll end up going in the direction I'm supposed to
            if I just put in some effort and be patient.
            <br><br>
            Stick around and see what I end up doing!
